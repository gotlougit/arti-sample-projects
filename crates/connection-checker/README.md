# Connection Checker

This small tool attempts to check connectivity to the Tor network through a variety of ways:

- Directly

- Via a bridge

- Via various pluggable transports (obfs4, meek-azure, snowflake)

It will then print the results of each test

Note that only a connection to a clearnet website is to be tested for now
